# Fields Admin 3 - Django Rest Framework Backend

This is the latest iteration of the Fields Admin web app. I decided to do a complete re-write of the app to separate the front-end and back-end. The current version of the software only has basic student profile management, but will be brought to feature parity with previous versions and include attendance tracking, class management and a fun point system for the students. Invoicing, analytics and a student-facing interface are the next few items on the to-do list.
