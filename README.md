# Fields Admin 3 - React Frontend

This is the latest iteration of the Fields Admin web app. I decided to do a complete re-write of the app to seperate the front-end and back-end. The current version of the sortward only has bascic student profile management, but will be brough to parity with the previous version and include attendance tracking, class management and a fun point system for the students. Invoicing, analytics and a student-facing interface are the next few items on the to-do list.
